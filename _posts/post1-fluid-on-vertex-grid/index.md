title: "A Different Approach to 2D Fluid Simulation"
---

Here we will explore a method for creating a 2d fluid simulation, without having to write code for advecting the fluid, and without a need to a compute shader stage. Only using vertex+fragment shader stages. As example we will implement the idea on openGL.


```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
