# About Me

Hi — I’m **Your Name**, a developer and writer who enjoys exploring ideas through code, words, and experiments.  
This site is a small digital notebook where I share thoughts, snippets, and notes on whatever I’m learning.

I believe in:
- Simplicity in design  
- Clarity in code  
- Depth in thought  

If you’d like to reach out, you can find me on:  
📧 [your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com)  
🐙 [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername)

*Thanks for stopping by.*
